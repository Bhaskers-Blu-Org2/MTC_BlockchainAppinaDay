# MTC Blockchain App in a Day, Microsoft Technology Center
Blockchain is disrupting how industries are solving business problems and creating new markets for products and services. The Blockchain App in a Day is an instructor-led workshop delivered through Microsoft Technology Centers/Microsoft Partners. In the Azure Blockchain sample repository, there are many examples of applications that can be directly deployed in a self-led exercise.  This workshop is a single- or two-day event with much deeper context of the Microsoft blockchain strategy while specifically focusing on hands-on designing, developing, and deploying Azure Blockchain Workbench solutions.

## Target Audience
Developers seeking to gain hands-on design, development, and deployment knowledge in blockchain, it is assumed the attendee has a development background in Java or C#. This workshop is not an advanced blockchain development workshop; rather, it’s a hands-on introduction focused on developing a blockchain solution and the process for creating blockchain applications.
 
## Learning Objectives
- Validate if blockchain is important for a solution
- Deploy Azure Blockchain Workbench
- Configure local machines for blockchain development
- Review a completed solution and its architecture
- Break down a business sample into an MVP
- Deploy the sample blockchain application
- Develop a blockchain solution for a pre-defined business use case
- Discuss architectural concepts beyond the MVP
- Identify ways to engage in deeper strategy, design, and POCs
    
## Requirements
1. Each attendee must have their own PC pre-configured according to provided instructions
2. Each attendee/company must have access to an Azure subscription with the right to deploy resource groups and services
3. Pre-work must be completed and validated prior to the workshop. No time will be spent on pre-work during the workshop; it’s important this work is completed ahead of time.
